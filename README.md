--------Research Problem--------
 
1. What is Dyslexia and the World Impact of Dyslexia 
Dyslexia is a specific learning disability characterized by difficulties with accurate 
word recognition, poor spelling, and decoding abilities. It affects approximately 10% 
of the global population, impacting individuals' academic performance, self-esteem, 
and socio-economic opportunities. 
 
2. Impact of Dyslexia on Different Age Groups 
Dyslexia affects individuals differently depending on their age. In early childhood, it 
manifests as difficulty learning letters and their sounds, delayed speech 
development, and trouble with phonological awareness. As children grow older, 
these challenges extend to reading fluency, comprehension, and writing, significantly 
affecting their academic achievements and confidence. 
 
3. Impact on Students Aged 5-6 
For children aged 5-6, the critical period for foundational literacy skills, dyslexia can 
hinder the acquisition of basic reading and writing abilities. This can lead to 
frustration, low self-esteem, and reluctance towards learning, which can persist 
throughout their academic journey if not addressed early. 
 
4. Importance of Early Support in Education
Providing early support in education for dyslexic students is crucial. Early educational 
interventions can help these children develop essential reading and writing skills, 
improving their overall educational outcomes and reducing the long-term impact of 
the disorder. Effective early support can foster confidence, enhance academic 
performance, and build a solid foundation for future learning. 
 
5. Challenges in Countries Like Sri Lanka 
In countries like Sri Lanka, there is limited awareness and resources dedicated to 
dyslexia. This often results in late diagnoses and inadequate support for affected 
children. Cultural stigmas and lack of trained professionals further exacerbate the 
issue, leaving many children without the necessary help to succeed academically.


-----Research Solution------

To address the challenges associated with dyslexia in children aged 5-6, our mobile 
app integrates several key components. The Writing and Listening Assistant helps 
students develop fine motor skills and literacy by allowing them to practice tracing 
shapes and Sinhala letters with guided visual and audio cues. The integration of 
machine learning personalizes learning paths and offers real-time feedback, ensuring 
targeted support for each child's needs. The Interactive Handwriting Practice 
component uses an interactive whiteboard and machine learning to enhance 
handwriting skills, providing immediate feedback and tracking progress to reinforce 
learning. This component also includes memory tracking exercises that help 
reinforce previously learned words through repetition and context. 
 
The Sinhala Speech and Pronunciation Enhancement Module focuses on improving 
phonemic awareness and pronunciation. It uses interactive flashcards, syllable 
clapping games, and read-aloud practice with speech recognition to provide 
feedback and adapt to the child's progress. This component also incorporates fun 
activities like sound matching games and sing-along sessions to make learning 
engaging. Finally, the Sentence Construction and Storytelling component helps 
children form coherent sentences and understand story structures through 
interactive drag-and-drop exercises and picture sequence storytelling. Adaptive 
algorithms adjust the difficulty level based on individual performance, ensuring 
personalized learning experiences. Collectively, these components provide a 
comprehensive, engaging, and adaptive educational support system tailored to the 
needs of dyslexic children, enhancing their reading, writing, and speaking skills in 
Sinhala.
